What are the differences between "bending waves" and "density waves" in the ring system?
What evidence do the authors have that these waves are driven by internal modes on the planet, rather than from moons or something else?
What "type" of interior modes are the ones that are thought to produce the ring features?
What physical quantity are the authors measuring to show that there are some sort of waves in the particular ring area at which they are looking?
What potential for understanding Saturn is opened up by these observations? I.e., can these waves be exploited for something?
