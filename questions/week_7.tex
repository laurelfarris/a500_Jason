\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Explain why the 12 M$_{\odot}$ star loses mass according to
        Figure 1.}

        The mass falls sharply when the outer layers of the star
        become convective.

    \item \textbf{Why would stellar cores increase their spin rate as
        they move into evolved stages?}

        As the star evolves, it fuses heavier and heavier elements.
        Increased mass results in increases spin rate, according to
        maths.

    \item \textbf{How much (by what factor) does Figure 5 predict
        that the spin rates of the inner core would increase from
        H burning to C burning?}

    \item \textbf{From the same figure, by what factor do gravity
        waves halt such spinning up?}

\end{enumerate}
